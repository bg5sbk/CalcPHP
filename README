=== Introduction ===

CalcPHP is a math expression calculator write in PHP. 

I write it just for fun and for programming language parsing and compiling study purpose.

It provide a simple "calculator language" like "1 + 1" or "1 * (2 + 3)".

And will be support variable, control flow, user function, extend function.

You can use it by include "CalcPHP.php" in your app and execute match expression in your app by :

    $parser = new CalcParser($code);

    $ast = $parser->Run();

    $result = $ast->Exec();

or run it in command line by :

    php CalcPHP.php

The command line example :

    CalcPHP command line interface V1.0
    > 1.
    result: 1.000000 (0.000102 sec)
    > 1 + 2.
    result: 3.000000 (0.000133 sec)
    > 1 + 2 * 3.
    result: 7.000000 (0.000426 sec)
    > 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.
    result: 2.500000 (0.000357 sec)
    > (1 + 2) * (3 / 4).
    result: 2.250000 (0.000329 sec)
    > exit
