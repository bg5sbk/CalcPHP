=== Introduction ===

CalcPHP is a math expression calculator write in PHP. 

I write it just for fun and for programming language parsing and compiling study purpose.

It provide a simple "calculator language" like "1 + 1" or "1 * (2 + 3)".

And will be support variable, control flow, user function, extend function.

You can use it by include "CalcPHP.php" in your app and execute match expression in your app by :

   $parser = new CalcParser($code);

   $ast = $parser->Run();

   $result = $ast->Exec();

or run it in command line by :

   php CalcPHP.php
